# JavaScript Paint

## Simple Paint Web-App w/ JS

## :cinema: Video:
* 

## :grey_question: What is it?
* A simple web app that is for drawing. You can paint to a screen, clear the screen, change colors, and some other features.
* I wanted to get into learning some JavaScript without continuing only with a book, so I figured I'd start a project.
* Learned a lot about how JavaScript works (obviously just scratching surface at the moment). Very interesting stuff!

## :zap: Features:
* Paint to web screen!
* Change colors of brush!
* Change size of brush!
* Clear canvas!

###### :hammer: To do:
* Look more into JavaScript syntax / traits. 
* Look more into objects in JS. Seem to behave a little differently than I imagined coming from Python and Java.
* Right now this is too clunky for my taste!
